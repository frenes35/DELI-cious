# Project Title

Deli-cious Order System

## Description of the Project
![diagram.png](diagram.png)
The Deli-cious Order System is a simple app that lets users order sandwiches,
drinks, and chips. Users can choose sandwich size, bread type, toppings, sauces,
drink flavors, and chip types to customize their order.

The system shows the total price and provides an order summary before finalizing.
After placing an order, users get a receipt with all items and costs.
This app is great for small restaurants to make order-taking fast and easy.
